# Enigma_Workshop

This project will lead up to making a working replica of an Enigma Machine using Python. 

Ongoing subprojects:
1. Smart Caeser Shift Decoder -- Runs thorugh all possibilities of decoded text and returns the one which is the correct decoded version. Uses Python library PyDictionary to check for valid English words.

Completed subprojects:
1. Caeser Shift Encoder -- Takes in a string, shift('a' for Caeser A Shift, 'b' for Caesar B Shift, etc.) and outputs the encoded version of that string. 
2. Caeser Shift Decoder -- Takes in a string, shift and outputs the decoded version of that string. Note that one can only use this decoder when they know which shift was used to encode the given string. 
3. Caeser Shift Encoder/Decoder -- Takes in a string, shift, and command 'encode' or 'decode'. Outputs encoded/decoded string.
