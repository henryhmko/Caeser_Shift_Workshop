# Caeser_Shift_Workshop

This project will lead up to making a working replica of an Enigma Machine using Python.

Ongoing subprojects:


Completed subprojects:
1. Caeser Shift Encoder -- Takes in a string, shift('a' for Caeser A Shift, 'b' for Caesar B Shift, etc.) and outputs the encoded version of that string.
2. Caeser Shift Decoder -- Takes in a string, shift and outputs the decoded version of that string. Note that one can only use this decoder when they know which shift was used to encode the given string.
3. Caeser Shift Encoder/Decoder -- Takes in a string, shift, and command 'encode' or 'decode'. Outputs encoded/decoded string.
4. Smart Caeser Shift Decoder -- Runs through all possibilities of decoded text and returns the one which is the correct decoded version. Uses Python library PyEnchant to check for valid English words.
